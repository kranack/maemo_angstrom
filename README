BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

*Adding to the recipe files: 

1.All the files except for the l10n folder go under ${OE_HOME}/openembedded/recipes/maemo-oe/
2.The localization folder goes directly under ${OE_HOME}/openembedded/recipes
(Atleast it needs to, if you have your bitbake.conf taking recipes as within ${OEHOME}/openembedded/recipes/*/*.bb)
NOTE: The tarballs for hildon-desktop and hildon-desktop-python-loader are locally hosted. 
The corresponding recipes use file:// in their SRC_URI
3. The image file, hildon-angstrom-image.bb goes under images.
4. For checksums.ini, merge into the existing one ????

* The above steps should let one get started with an image build.
* There are some *nasty* manual additions (aarrgghh) to the image as mentioned below:

1. The dbus-launch binary is for some reason not added to the ipk, and to the rootfs.
I am adding it manually at the moment.
2. Other manual additions include a set of .desktop files for hildon-desktop, and a script
for getting the desktop environment started. The gdk-pixbuf ipk's binaries don't get pulled into
the rootfs at the moment, so they too are added that way.

To deal with the above, extract the "add-me.tar.gz" tarball after cd-ing to / in your rootfs
